# Introduction

- Was sind die Zeile?
- Nice to have: Cards wie bei TESPy. Aber erst am Ende. Nicht zwischendurch, weil es Spa√ü macht!

In this chapter exergy analysis is introduced and applied to simple processes with single components. The differences
between energy balancing and the exergy method is outlied. While such models can easily be set up manually, and
specific to each application, the last example introduces the usage of the software TESPy.

The following sections contain these examples:

- {ref}`Flow of steam through an adiabatic pipe <adiabaitc-pipe-label>`
- {ref}`Heat exchanger for district heating <heat-exchanger-label>`
- {ref}`Production of compressed air <compressed-air-label>`
