# TESPy_teaching_exergy
Open Source Engineering Course on Exergy Analysis using TESPy

Templates we can make use of:

- https://github.com/executablebooks/quantecon-mini-example
  - can automatically be hosted with github pages and provides downloadable markdown, pdf and ipynb
  - simple tables, figures with subscripts and equation numbering as well as referencing and bibliography

- https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/start/build.html
  - We write pure ipynb, equation numbers etc. might be tricky
  - Less syntax stuff to care about, but also less capabilities
