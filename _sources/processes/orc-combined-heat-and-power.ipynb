    "Subject of the following example of a more complex thermodynamic process will be a combined geothermal heat and power plant. As even deep geothermal boreholes can not supply temperatures high enough to drice conventional powerplant processes, such as the aforementioned and thoroughly analyzed Clausius Rankine Cycle, adjustments are necessary. Organic process fluids whose vaporization temperature is lower than that of water allow the execution of a Rankine cycle at these lower heat source temperatures, resulting in the so called *Organic Rankine Cycle*.\n",

    "Your model very likely will be quite complex and use a lot of components which need parametrization. Building the whole model at once likely results in too few or too many parameters, which can be hard to track down. Oftentimes, a better approach is to build parts of the model, e.g. inner cycles or outer strands, and make them work. Only then the parts are joined together to build the whole process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, you will probably encouter issues when setting terminal temperature differences without stable starting values. As mentioned in other examples, running the model with best-guess starting values before finalizing parametrization strengthens stability and can even be necessary.

    "For the cogeneration of heat and power, an ORC using the liquid phase from the geothermal source will be employed to solely supply power. The gaseous mass fraction can be fed directly through a steam turbine and condensated to supply the district heating network with heat. The process diagram of the described CHP plant can be found in {numref}`orc-chp-flowsheet`. The heat outflow to close the Organic Rankine Cycle is realized through cooling with ambient air. Finally, the two streams from the geothermal source are combined again to be fed back into the geothermal sink.\n",
