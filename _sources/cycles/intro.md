# Introduction

After learning how to model thermodynamic processes with TESPy and how to set up the exergy analysis method, this
chapter focuses on well known processes, i.e.

- {ref}`the (open) brayton cycle and gas turbine <brayton-label>`,
- {ref}`the Clausius-Rankine cycle <rankine-label>` and
- {ref}`a compression heat pump process <heat-pump-label>`.

You will learn how to set up larger models with TESPy and how to apply the exergy analysis to them. Furthermore,
parametric analysis of component and process parameters show, how exergy analysis can help to identify cycle
inefficiencies, or finding improvements.
